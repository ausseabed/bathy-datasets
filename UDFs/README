Prototype User Defined Functions (UDFs) specifically for the ARDC-PL019 GMRT project.

The gsf_etl.py contains several entire modules. It was easier to bundle them together
into a singlular file and build several UDFs rather than trying to deploy a module to
a cloud environment that we don't control.
Conceptually, these USFs could be built from simple scripts that append the content to
a single file.

The benefit of the UDFs is that we don't need to mess around with deployment of the
full stack of software requirements. And then defining a scalable computational environment.
The UDFs are stored internally as TileDB arrays, and registered with TileDB-Cloud.
Another benefit is that these UDFs can be shared with others (people, groups, orgs etc)
and they don't have to worry about the deployment either. The just need to execute them
as any normal function (still required to have a TileDB-Cloud account), and TileDB-Cloud
spins up a resource, executes the func, and returns the result to a user.
The base idea here, is that AusSeabed can share these UDFs with other members, who can
execute them without having to deploy the code nor the scalable computational architecture.
Meaning, we all collaborate more effectively, share the code and compute more easily.

Essentially, we get to the business requirements more effectively, and work on the real problems and
leave the scalable computational architecture to the professionals. No reason these
days for orgs that are collaborating (or attempting to, whilst still competing for the
small bucket of resources), to then each design and build independently full stack
scalable compute that would need an ever ongoing support and maintenance.
