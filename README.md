# bathy-datasets
A tool for writing bathymetric metadata and building datasets.


The code developed within is considered a prototype, and was developed specifically
for the [ARDC PL019 GMRT project](https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/c09a1237-f1af-4f1b-8509-4eae5636fd14).

Whilst it was used in a small-scale production sense for the project, care
must still be taken as it was designed specifically to meet the requirements
of the project.
